      In general, I try to live up to these values:</br>
      Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</br>
      Ambition 5</br>
      Creativity 4</br>
      Leadership 4</br>
      Adventure 3</br>
      Truth 5</br>
      Wealth 2</br>
      Challenge 4</br>
      Romance 2</br></br>
      Out of these values, <b>Ambition</b> is the most important to me.</br>
      This is important to me as I always try to keep a long term view on things and constantly ask myself what the end goal is. I often wonder, what is that one thing I want to know on my death bed 40-50 years from now that will make a satisfied life. What is that one acheivement in life that will put a smile on my face even on my way out?</br></br>
      The last piece of advice I gave someone was on Romance and specifically finding a partner. My advice to my friend was that it is highly unlikely to find the perfect partner for most people. So, when he comes across different partner options in his life, he should consider if he has reached a point in knowing <b>enough</b> about a person and that if some new negative thing comes to knowledge, he would still love his partner.
