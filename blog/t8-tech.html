      Before DBC, I had often heard about Ruby on Rails, but never thought of them seperatly. Now that we know some basic Ruby programming language, what is this other piece <b>Rails</b>?</br></br>
      A good question to ask at this point is, where would the HTML,CSS,Ruby,JavaScript,SQL code that I have learned go? How will it all work together to enable a decent website? What we need to achieve something like that is an environment with predefined "rules of engagment" among different pieces or a Framework.</br>
      Thats exactly what Rails provides us. Its a framework that setups a methodology on how a decent website will function. This website will include different HTML webpages with CSS or Javascript and have some Ruby plus SQL code to manage our databases on the servers. Rails defines this front-end and back-end design theme as well as enables the communication between the two.
