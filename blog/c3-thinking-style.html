      <b>Multi Modal Learning Style</b>
      <p>
        As my learning style suggests, I am able to absorb the most when the ideas are presented in multiple formats. This past week, we went through the exercises of using multiple tools like wireframing and code sharing through pair programming. This pace of switching the tools that we use for learning the same concepts really helps me understand similar things from different frames of view.</br>But, using different tools does require one to keep practicing using all of them to get comfortable and get the most value out of them. At DBC, this would mean that I need to carefully select the the few tools that I have time to understand and get the most value out of.

    <h3><b>Learning Mindset</b></h3>

      <b>Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</b>
      I have enjoye the mini examples so far. I thought that since I have been coding in C/C++ for a few years now, I can jump onto the big stuff right away. But, the sample problems show that it is better to take mini steps to grow my understanding one step at a time.
