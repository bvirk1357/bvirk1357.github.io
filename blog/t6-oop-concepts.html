    <h3><b>Global Variables</b></h3>
    <p>
      As the name suggests, these variables are accessible anywhere in a program, in any class, in any loop... anywhere. Because they dont have any limits to where they can be accessed, there use is not recommended. Their name have to start with a '$'
      </br>E.g.: $global_variable
    </p>

    <h3><b>Instance Variables</b></h3>
    <p>
      Variables declared inside a class definition with a '@' are accessible anywhere in an instance of that class. Note that two instances of that same class will have seperate copies of the instance variable
      </br>E.g.: @instance_variable
    </p>

    <h3><b>Local Variables</b></h3>
    <p>
      Local variables exist within the method or loop where they are declared.
      Their names should start either with a lower case or underscore
      </br>E.g.: local_variable, _LocalVariable
    </p>

    <h3><b>Constant Variables</b></h3>
    <p>
      Constant values in a class are accessible anywhere in a class.
    </p>

    <h3><b>Class Variables</b></h3>
    <p>
      These variables can be considered to have the next level of scope compared to Instance variables because, they are shared by all instances of a class. This allows multiple instances of a class communicate to each other. Their names start with a '@@'
      </br>E.g.: @@class_variable
    </p>
