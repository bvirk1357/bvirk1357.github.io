      We humans are social animals. We constantly keep in our minds what others are thinking of us. We desire to receive praise and positive feedback for our actions from our peers. But, when we realize even a hint of a true or false perception that is negative, it affects our performance for the worse.</br>
      Stereotype Threat defines this behavior of a person in that when they are subject to any preconcieved notion of how other's expect him/her to perform, especially in a negative way, it lowers the outcome.</br>
      Living in the bay area, we often deal with some specific stereotypes. Being the Silicon Valley, there is a heavy presence of individuals with degress in engineering and similar sciences. Personally, I deal with the before mentioned stereotype as well racial ones. To some extent, I do tolerate them and I do not see them completely going away.</br>
      But, being aware of these stereotypes has helped me deal with them in a positive way. Instead of letting them affect my performance in any way, I am able to tell myself where these perceptions might be coming from other person and how I can appropriatly educate them to correct those perceptions.
