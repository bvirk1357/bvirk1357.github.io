      Imagine that you have been tasked to plan and develop a housing complex. Each house can have 2 or 3 bedrooms.</br>
      As a first step, you would plan what to do before starting to build the houses. When you do this with your builders, they ask you for the blueprint of the houses you want them to build. If you have two houses to build at this point, one with 2 bedrooms and the other with 3 bedrooms, would you develop two seperate blueprints from scratch? It seems like the extra bedroom is the only difference between the two houses, so why plan on writing two blueprints with so much overlap in the blueprints?</br>
      A smarter way would be to write up just one blueprint that allows the builders to use it for both 2 and 3 bedroom houses. This allows for a more efficient planning to developing flow.</br>
    </br>
      Classes in Ruby serve the same purpose. All types of houses, no matter how many bedrooms they have are still houses, or are still of the same class, a house.
