    <h3><b>The Pairing experience</b></h3>
    <p>
      Pair programming is completely new to me. Coming from a different engineering work environment, at first it seemed counter intuitive. Why would we make two people focus on the same task, when they could work on two and build two things instead of one.</br>
      I realized during my pairing sessions that not only is there value in pairing because you avoid writing error prone and less efficient coding which saves time later, but also helps improve skills for the people involved. That last part further gives a higher ROI.</br>
      </br>
      It was fun to bounce off ideas to refactor and improve our initial solutions. There was real learning there because I usually dont have any issues coding the initial solutions. Its the smarter ways to accomplish tasks with one liners that makes it fun.</br></br>
      As it is new to me, it does take me time to find the right balance of supporting as a navigator and not "back seat driving" when navigating. I also learned through my feedback that I tend to refer to google more than I should be to find out different methods for RubyDoc classes.

    <h3><b>Getting and Giving the Feedback</b></h3>
    <p>
      Getting the feedback is great. Everytime I read one, I get to see myself from someone else's point of view. I have already learned a few things that I plan on improving the next time I pair, like thinking and discussing with my pair a little bit more before referring to google for understanding ruby classes and methods.</br></br>
      Giving feedback to others is a delicate process. You want to let your pair know how they could improve in the best way. This is where the empathy your show is really important.
