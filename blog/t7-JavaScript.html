  <h1><b>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</b></h1>
  <h4>5.23.15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      If I was to describe <b>Ruby Hashes</b> in one line:</br>
      An unordered collection of paired items, where one is a key that points to it's value.</br>
      If I was to descibe <b>Javascript Objects</b> in one line:</br>
      An unordered list of properties, where a key can point to another object with more properties, where those proporties can point to another set of objects that then further contain more....</br></br>
      Compared to each other, Ruby Hashes are more restrictive in how its elements can be defined and accessed. Javascript hashes on the other hand let one defined multiple level of properties and objects easily.</br>
      Another big difference is how Javascript treates a function as an object as well. So, an object's property can be called with '()' to execute the function. That function can also access all the properties of that table.</br>
      So, where one would have to define a class in Ruby that has functions or methods that work on that class's variables, in Javascript, we can just use an object with the class's variables as some properties and the function that works on those variables just another property of that same Javascript object.
