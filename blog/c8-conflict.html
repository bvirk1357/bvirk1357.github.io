    <h3>Time I had a conflict</h3>
      <p>
        Work conflict. I had just graduated and had been working for about 6 months. I was in a position to lead others by telling them what we should design. I was very demanding and expecting everyone to accomplish the same things that I can. But, that wasnt the case. I would quote x number of days to implement a feature with others, but a few times we were delayed in delivering it. This made me really angry with people I was working with.
      </p>
    <h3>Emotions</h3>
      <p>
        Impatience, Anger, lack of Empathy.
      </p>
    <h3>Actions</h3>
      <p>
        I started to comminucate more and understand what some reasons were why other people could not deliver at the same short time that I wanted to.
      </p>
    <h3>Handle differently</h3>
      <p>
        I started quoting longer time periods to get features done. I made sure that my peers felt less pressure on getting work done.
      </p>
    <h3>Learning</h3>
      <p>
        My motivations, lifestyle and rules that work for me most probably do not work for other people. So, If I want to enable others to achieve the most working with me, the first things to do is to understand where they are coming from. Why are they working on the current task? What makes them tick?
