    <h2><b>Digital Inclusion</b></h2>
    <p>
      One thing that I find hard to contemplate is how the tech industry is always focused on creating products for revenue. In our website design course, we will be looking into how to design the most efficient and dynamic websites that look great. All this is being done without the creators of these products thinking that most people on the planet do not even have access to the basic form of internet.
      </br>
      We take certain things for granted when it comes to the internet. We always know in the back of our mind that we will have access to any information that is publicly available through a quick smart phone search. In tough times, for example, if I am looking for a job, or if I am looking into cures for a disease, we can quickly "Google" the results. But, imagine living the life of someone in a remote African village or even in the slums in Rio De Jeniro or Mumbai. People there dont have access to the same things.
      </br>
      So, I ask myself, what is more important? Should I focus my energy on creating beautiful and dynamic websites and apps for masses that like to swipe, or should I focus on bringing the most basic capabilities to those in the most need? When will we see the day that includes everyone into the digital world? When would it be a decent assumption that anyone living in a developed nation like US can connect with anyone in a developing nation.
